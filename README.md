# Mini Shell

Final project of the course Operative Systems I, from UIB. This project was made with the collaboration of [Marc Link](https://github.com/linkcla) and [Carlos Gálvez](https://github.com/Carlgm-18) 🫱🏽‍🫲🏽.

This is only the last part of the project, which was developed by levels and can be found [here](https://github.com/jcasben/Programacion-Ing-Informatica/tree/master/2-Ing-Informatica/1-Cuatrimestre/sistemas-operativos-I/practica2).

## Overview 🔍

This project consists in a minimal version of a shell where we can execute some internal commands that we developed and the rest of the commands that can be executed on Linux. With this shell we can also stop processes and then restart them in the foreground or in the background.

## How to use it

1. First of all, you have to clone this repository. You can do it this way opening a terminal on the desired directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jcasben/mini_shell.git
```

2. Once you have it, you can run this command to make an executable of the program:

```bash
make mini_shell
```

3. Now you can execute the program:

```bash
./mini_shell
```

**IMPORTANT:** this project was made on top of WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), so it only works on linux based operative systems.
